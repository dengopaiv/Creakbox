"""Finding I: prove by construction that DSP state is written on ONE thread.

MSVC ships AddressSanitizer but not ThreadSanitizer, so the acceptance test that
finding I asked for - "under a sanitiser build, reporting no race on the DSP
fields" - cannot be run as written on this toolchain. ASan does not detect data
races. This is the substitute, and it is arguably the better test anyway: rather
than observing that no race happened during one run, it checks the property that
makes a race impossible.

Run it with:

    python tools/check_dsp_ownership.py

The property: every non-atomic member that the DSP touches is assigned ONLY from
functions the audio thread calls. Anything the UI thread can reach must go
through an atomic.
