"""Keyboard regression checks. Every failure this catches is SILENT in use.

Four ways a key can quietly do nothing in this window, all of them shipped here
at some point:

  1. Two accelerators on one chord - the first entry wins and the second can
     never fire. (Ctrl+Shift+N was bound twice.)
  2. An unmodified key bound as an accelerator - TranslateAccelerator runs
     before IsDialogMessage, so the key goes dead on every control in the
     window. (Space was bound to run/stop.)
  3. Two controls with the same mnemonic - Win32 cycles focus between them
     instead of activating either. (Alt+V, between Volume and a checkbox.)
  4. A mnemonic shadowed by an accelerator on the same chord - the accelerator
     is consulted first, so the underline is a promise that never fires.
     (Alt+A, Alt+S and Alt+R, which is what finding F was.)
  5. Two items in the same menu popup with the same mnemonic - cycles exactly
     like case 3, one namespace down. ("&Next" against "&New pattern".)
  6. A key bound to a command NOTHING HANDLES - the accelerator fires, the
     WM_COMMAND is sent, the switch has no case for it, and the message falls
     into DefWindowProc. The menu item is enabled, the accelerator text is
     printed beside it and F1 documents it, and pressing it does nothing at
     all. (Copy / Cut / Paste pattern, all three, from the beginning.)

Checks 1-5 all ask whether a keystroke ARRIVES. Check 6 is the one that asks
whether anything is waiting for it when it does, which is why the first five
passed for as long as they did while three menu items were dead.

None of these produce an error, a warning, or a log line. Run this after any
edit to resource.rc or to a control's label:
