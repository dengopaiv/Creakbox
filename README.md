# Creakbox

An extension of CreakBox: a standalone Windows bassline synth and step sequencer, built
to be **fully usable from the keyboard and by a screen reader**. It started from a
TB-303-style voice and still has one at its core, but it has grown well past imitating
the 303 — variable-length and triplet patterns, reverse step, a PWM LFO, noise, and an
acid FX block are all things the original box never had.

The DSP is the original 2002–2004 Frank Reitz ("Bass Assessor") CreakBox / SilverBox
engine, lifted verbatim. What was rewritten is everything around it: the VST plumbing
and the bitmap-knob GUI are gone, replaced by a plain Win32 application built out of
standard system controls.

---

## Lineage

| | |
|---|---|
| `CREAKBOX.EXE` | The original 2002 Delphi freeware release. Kept in the tree as reference and as the source of truth for `.cb` behaviour. |
| `src/SilverBox*.cpp`, `knobs.*`, `CPitchSlider.*`, `main.cpp` | The 2004 C++ VST source. **Reference only — not compiled.** |
| `src/CBEngine.*`, `src/MainWindow.*`, … | The current standalone. This is what `CMakeLists.txt` builds. |
| `src/IIR.*`, `src/dist.*`, `src/freq.*`, `src/core.h` | Original DSP, reused as-is by the standalone. |

The sound is deliberately *not* a reinterpretation. The filter, oscillators, envelope
and accent behaviour are the 2004 code paths; changes to the engine are held to a
standard of keeping every new feature's "off" state bit-identical to the engine that
preceded it (see [Engine invariants](#engine-invariants)).

Most of the original 2004 files carry the read-only attribute on disk. That is
intentional — it is a speed bump against editing reference sources by accident.

---

## Building

Requirements: Windows, MSVC (Visual Studio 2022 or newer), CMake 3.20+. No external
dependencies — everything links against the Win32 SDK.

```
cmake -S . -B build -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The result is `build/Release/Creakbox.exe`.

C++17, `/permissive-`, `/utf-8`, Unicode build (`UNICODE`/`_UNICODE`), `WIN32` subsystem.

> **If configure fails** with a message about a missing `CMakeSystem.cmake.in` under a
> CMake version you no longer have installed, the cache is stale. Delete
> `build/CMakeCache.txt` and `build/CMakeFiles/` and reconfigure. Do not delete the rest
> of `build/` — it also holds `Release/` and the packaged modules.

---

## Running

- **Audio out:** WASAPI shared mode on the default Windows endpoint, on its own render
  thread (`src/AudioEngine.cpp`). The device's own sample rate is used; nothing is
  resampled.
- **MIDI in:** the first enumerated WinMM input device, note-on / note-off only
  (`src/MidiInput.cpp`). MIDI notes play the voice independently of the sequencer.
  External clock sync is not implemented.
- **Modules:** `modules/` holds the shipped content — 56 `.cb` presets from 2006–2010
  plus a handful of `.roq` songs.

## The design rule that governs everything

> Every control is a **standard system control** preceded by a **STATIC label**.

Nothing here implements `IAccessible` or defines a custom accessible object, and nothing
should. Screen readers announce name and value correctly because the controls are real
trackbars, comboboxes, checkboxes and list boxes with real preceding labels. The only
accessibility API in the codebase is `NotifyWinEvent` — used to fire name-change and
value-change events when a control's text is updated programmatically, which is the one
case the system cannot infer on its own.

Three consequences worth internalising before touching the UI:

1. **Don't grey out a control to signal "inert".** A disabled control announces as
   *unavailable* with no discoverable reason. Say it in the label instead. The oscillator
   dialog does this: when the main waveform is a saw, the PWM LFO depth label retitles
   itself to note that it currently has no effect — the control stays reachable and stays
   explicable.
2. **Programmatic text changes must go through `announceValue()`**, which sets the text
   and then fires `EVENT_OBJECT_NAMECHANGE` / `EVENT_OBJECT_VALUECHANGE`. Calling
   `SetWindowText` directly leaves a screen reader reading stale state.
3. **A synthesised selection change needs its `WM_COMMAND` sent too.** The note combobox
   shows the pattern: its Page Up/Down octave jump sets the selection, posts
   `CBN_SELCHANGE` to the parent itself, and then notifies.

---

## Control surface

### Main window

| Control | Notes |
|---|---|
| Waveform | Saw / Square |
| Tempo | BPM |
| Transport | A Run/Stop toggle button; the keyboard has four separate actions on F5–F8 (song / pattern / from-current / stop) |
| Pattern selector | The editing index is **decoupled** from the playback index, so edits stay put while the sequence runs |
| Volume, Cutoff, Resonance, EnvMod, Decay, Accent, Tuning | Seven trackbars. Arrows ±1, PgUp/PgDn ±10, Home/End to the rails. **Resonance, EnvMod and Tuning are bipolar (−100…+100)** — negative values give Frank's "inverted" filter character. |
| Resonance boost | Checkbox under the Resonance slider. Devilfish-style; see below. |
| Random wildness | Density for the random-pattern generators (0 = sparse, ~0.5 = 2002 defaults, 1 = chaos) |
| Accent squelch | Residual-stacking amount. `1.0` = Frank's original TB-303 accent buildup, `0` = no stacking, `>1` = progressively squelchier consecutive accents. |
| Pattern length | 1–64 steps, per pattern. Sits just before the step list in tab order. See below. |
| Triplet feel | Per pattern, beside the length. `Ctrl+T`. Makes a step an eighth-note triplet, so 12 steps fill a bar. |
| Step editor | One step selector + pitch combo (Rest, C0–B4) + slide / accent / reverse-step checkboxes |
| Oscillator… | Opens the oscillator dialog |
| Acid FX… | Opens the FX dialog — distortion, compressor, ring modulator. `Alt+X` or `Ctrl+D`. |

**Press Enter on any of the seven parameter sliders to open its sweep editor.**

### Oscillator dialog

Everything here is beyond the stock 303, and everything defaults to transparent.

- **Main PWM** — square duty cycle, 50 % = stock.
- **Sub sine level** — sine one octave down, mixed in. Default 0.
- **Noise level** — white noise into the oscillator sum. Default 0. It sits *before* the
  filter and the gate, so it is shaped by the filter sweep and rests stay silent. The
  trade-off is that at the low cutoffs where a 303 usually lives the filter eats most of
  it — correct for an oscillator-section noise source, but it means the control feels
  weak down there. A raw hiss layer on top would be a different (post-filter) feature.
- **Duplet** — a second oscillator with its own waveform, its own PWM, ±1200 cents detune
  and its own level. Default level 0.
- **PWM LFO (triangle, free-running)** — one shared rate, an independent depth into the
  main PWM and into the duplet PWM. See below.
- **"Everybody needs a 303"** — resets **every sound parameter** to stock voicing, the
  main-window sliders included, not just this dialog. It leaves patterns, sweeps and
  transport state alone, and it deliberately does **not** touch per-step reverse flags:
  those are pattern data, not sound parameters, and a reset must not silently edit
  patterns.

### Acid FX dialog

Three effects in series after the filter and the volume envelope — where a pedal sits
relative to a real 303's output. Chain order is **distortion → compressor → ring modulator**.

Everything in here obeys one admission rule: **an effect must not break the loop.** No delay
lines, no reverb tails, nothing time-based that would stop a one-pattern loop from repeating
identically. Anything that needs to know where the bar is belongs in sweeps instead.

#### Distortion

A pedal in front of the amp: it sits where the stock 2004 clipper always sat. Five models,
one type combo and three knobs — **gain**, **tone**, **level**.

| Type | What it models | Character |
|---|---|---|
| **Classic** | The stock 2004 `dist_dist()`, byte-for-byte | The Creakbox sound. Default. |
| **Rat** | ProCo RAT: a slew-limited op-amp into symmetric hard-clipping diodes, then a passive low-pass | The acid distortion. Roughly three quarters of pre-2000 acid records went through one. |
| **Screamer** | Tube Screamer: soft clipping in the feedback loop with the bass kept *out* of the clipper | Mid-forward and comparatively polite; thins a bassline out, which is why it cuts. |
| **Dist+** | MXR Distortion+: hard clipping with no slew limiting | Brighter and rawer than the RAT — that contrast is why both are here. |
| **Fuzz** | Germanium-ish asymmetric clipping at very high gain | Snarl and even harmonics. The stock clipper is asymmetric too (+0.8 / −0.78), so this is in keeping. |

**Classic is not a model, it is the original code path.** Type 0 calls the untouched
`dist_dist()` and the three knobs do nothing at all — verified byte-for-byte, not asserted.
That is what makes the whole block free: a song that never opens this dialog is bit-identical
to the engine before the block existed.

**Tone is the conventional way round — up is brighter.** A real RAT's "Filter" knob is wired
backwards, which is a famous piece of trivia and a bad property for a control that announces
its value to a screen reader, so the sense is corrected here.

**The knobs stay enabled while Classic is selected**, and say so in their labels instead
(`Gain (no effect — Classic)`). Disabling them would announce as *unavailable* with no
discoverable cause — the same rule the PWM LFO depth labels follow.

**On levels.** At the default gain of 0 the models sit between 0.3× and 1.7× the Classic
output, so picking one is not a volume jump. Wind the gain up and hard clipping does what
hard clipping does — around 6× at gain 0.6, because the output level stops depending on the
input. That is what the **level** knob is for. Screamer is the quiet one (≈0.3×): its
high-pass keeps the bass out of the clipper, which on a bassline is most of the energy.

#### Compressor

Two controls, **threshold** and **depth**. Glue that evens out accents, not a limiter —
depth 1.0 is a 3.3:1 ratio and no further. Auto make-up keeps it from reading as a volume
knob: the transfer curve pivots at full scale, so quieter material comes up and the loudest
material stays where it was.

The follower has an instant attack and a 120 ms release. That is not a simplification. With
a smoothed attack an individual sample can sit above the envelope that graded it, and the
make-up gain then pushes it past full scale — measured at 0.19 % of samples clipped at an
ordinary setting. With a peak follower the output bound becomes provable rather than
measured: an input inside ±1 cannot leave the stage outside ±1, at any threshold and any
depth.

Depth at 0 skips the follower entirely, and the threshold label says so.

#### Ring modulator

Two controls, **frequency** (5 Hz–2 kHz, exponential) and **amount** (dry to pure ring). The
carrier is a sine independent of the note, which is what makes it clangorous and inharmonic
rather than well-behaved — the sound people mean by "ring mod on a 303". Below ~30 Hz it is
a per-note tremolo; the low hundreds are where a bassline turns metallic; the top is bell
territory.

**The carrier restarts on every new note**, at its peak. Three reasons, and it is worth
knowing they point the same way: a free-running audio-rate carrier would drift against the
bar, so a one-pattern loop would stop repeating identically — which this block's admission
rule forbids; restarting gives every note the same timbre instead of one that lands
differently each time; and starting at the carrier's peak rather than at a zero crossing
keeps the note's attack transient intact. Tied notes keep the phase they started with.

Note the deliberate contrast with the PWM LFO, whose phase must **never** be reset: that one
is a slow modulator whose whole point is drifting across the bar, at a rate where drift is
audible *as* drift.

Amount at 0 skips the multiply entirely, and the frequency label says so.

### Sweeps — the modulation system

Sweeps are the canonical way to modulate anything in Creakbox. Each of the seven
parameter sliders carries its own list of sweeps; a sweep interpolates a slider value
between a `(pattern, step)` start point and a `(pattern, step)` end point. They can be
copied and pasted between parameters, saved on their own as `.hape`, and are stored in
every `.roq`.

**There is deliberately no general-purpose LFO.** Sweeps cover that ground, and cover it
with musical structure an LFO does not have.

The **PWM LFO is the single exception**, and the reason is structural rather than
stylistic: sweeps are evaluated once per sequencer step, which puts their ceiling around
10 Hz even at fast tempos, and they move in stairsteps. Per-sample duty-cycle modulation
up to 100 Hz is simply a different mechanism. It is free-running by design — the phase
survives pattern boundaries rather than relocking every bar. Its rate is stored in Hz
everywhere (engine and file), never as a slider position, so the UI's exponential taper
(0.05 – 100 Hz across positions 1–100, position 0 being an off detent) can change later
without repitching saved songs.

### Resonance boost

The filter clamps its resonance input at 1.0 and the knob already arrives at about 0.99,
so "more resonance" cannot be done by rescaling the knob — the clamp has to be crossed.
The filter has **no saturating nonlinearity in its feedback path**, so past the stability
point its state grows without bound and eventually goes NaN, permanently.

The switch therefore selects a *sibling* filter function,
`wwelti_IIR_IIRlp3pole_boost`, which raises the clamp slightly and bounds the resonant
integrator so the oscillation settles into a limit cycle. The stock
`wwelti_IIR_IIRlp3pole` is not edited at all, which is what makes "boost off" provably
identical to before.

The knob mapping *extends the ceiling* rather than lifting the whole range: a quartic
term is added to the resonance, inaudible through the usable travel and biting only at
the top. Nothing below roughly 70 % of travel changes audibly; self-oscillation starts
around 88–90 %.

### Pattern length

Each pattern is 1 to 64 steps, set on the **Pattern length** combo beside the step editor.
The step list rebuilds to match, so it always shows exactly the steps the pattern plays.

The sequencer never assumed 16. `CbPattern` has always carried 64 steps and the engine has
always looped at `lastStep`, derived song position from `lastStep + 1`, and picked the next
step from it. What was missing was a way to *say* anything but 16 — and, more importantly,
a way to save it: until `.roq` v10 the writer emitted exactly 16 step rows however long the
pattern claimed to be, so a 23-step pattern would have saved its declared length and
silently lost steps 17–23.

Three things worth knowing in use:

- **Shortening is not destructive within a session.** The steps past the new end keep their
  notes, and lengthening again brings them back. *Saving* is where they go: `.roq` writes
  only the live steps, which is what makes a short pattern short on disk.
- **Randomising the current pattern keeps its length.** It replaces the notes, not the
  shape. (Starting a *new* random pattern still gives you 16.)
- **Sweeps follow the pattern they name.** The sweep editor's step lists are sized to the
  pattern selected beside them, and change when you change that pattern. A sweep endpoint is
  positioned relative to its own pattern's length, so a sweep over a 16-step pattern ends
  where that pattern ends even when a 4-step pattern is playing.

Patterns of different lengths in one song is the point of the feature: 15 against 16 walks
the accents around the bar, and a short pattern against a long sweep is the cheap way to get
a phrase that never repeats the same way twice.

### Triplet feel

A checkbox beside Pattern length, **per pattern**, so a triplet fill can sit inside an
otherwise straight track. `Ctrl+T` from anywhere.

Off, a step is a **sixteenth** — sixteen of them to a 4/4 bar. On, a step is an **eighth-note
triplet**, a quarter divided by three, which is 4/3 longer. So:

| | 12 steps | 16 steps | 24 steps |
|---|---|---|---|
| **straight** | ¾ bar | 1 bar | 1½ bars |
| **triplet** | **1 bar** | 1⅓ bars | **2 bars** |

Twelve straight sixteenths is three quarters of a bar, so looping it against anything in 4/4
walks the downbeat around and re-aligns every three bars — a 3-against-4 polyrhythm. Useful,
and not a shuffle. Twelve *triplet* steps fill the bar exactly, which is the loping 12/8
groove.

**The point of the control is that it does that at the same tempo.** Getting the shuffle
before meant lying about the BPM: to make 12 steps fill one bar at 140 you had to type
**105** — a number with nothing to do with the music, out of step with every other device,
and recomputed by hand every time the real tempo moved. That arithmetic is what the checkbox
deletes.

Nothing else in the engine knows what a step is — the gate threshold, the note length a
reversed envelope is sized to, and the slide rate all derive from one number — so they follow
a triplet pattern without being told.

### The envelope — and why there are four of them

Creakbox inherits the 303's envelope arrangement verbatim, and it does not look like an
ADSR. There is no attack control, no sustain and no release. There is one **Decay** knob,
and it drives four separate pieces of state that all run at once. Anything described as
"changing the envelope" has to say *which* of the four it means, so they are set out here.

**1. `boxDecay_` — the filter envelope. This is the one people mean.**

Set to `4.0` at every new note (`triggerStep`, skipped on a slide) and then, every sample:

```cpp
boxDecay_ *= (knobDecay * 0.0005 + 0.9995);
```

A pure exponential decay toward zero. The multiplier runs from `0.9995` at knob 0
(τ ≈ 2000 samples ≈ 45 ms — fast) to exactly `1.0` at knob 1.0, where the envelope does not
decay at all and simply holds at 4.0. **Lower knob = faster decay**, which is worth saying
out loud because it catches people writing tests.

It reaches the filter here:

```cpp
tempcutoff = boxCutoff * getTab2Interpolated(
    boxMEG_ + (EnvMod * -2.0) + (boxDecay_ * EnvMod) + accent);
```

The two EnvMod terms collapse to `EnvMod * (boxDecay_ - 2.0)`. So the envelope is
**bipolar around `boxDecay_ == 2.0`**: the contribution starts at `+2·EnvMod`, crosses zero
when the decay passes 2.0, and heads for `−2·EnvMod`. The filter does not merely approach
the base cutoff — it sweeps *through* it and out the other side. That crossing is the
character of the sound.

How far it actually gets in one step matters. At Decay 0.70 and 130 BPM a 16th step is
about 5088 samples, and `boxDecay_` only travels 4.0 → ~1.9 in that time. The audible part
of a normal note is the **first, steepest section** of the curve, and the note is gated off
long before the envelope finishes.

**2. `boxMEG_` — the slow drift.** Reset to 0 at each note; ramps toward `−1.0` at
`0.0000082` per sample, or toward `−1.75` at `0.00009` when the step is accented. It is
added straight into the same cutoff index, so it is a gradual darkening of the whole filter
across the note. On a plain 16th it covers ~4 % of its travel — nearly nothing. On an
accented one, ~37 %. That asymmetry is a large part of why an accent does not just sound
louder.

**3. `boxVolEnv_` — the amplitude envelope, which barely does anything.** Set to 1.0 at each
note, decaying at `0.00001` per sample: τ ≈ 100 000 samples ≈ 2.3 s, far longer than any
step. Over one 16th it drops about 5 %. **A 303 note is essentially flat in amplitude.**

**4. `boxGate_` — what actually ends the note.** Rises to 1.0 with coefficient `0.9`
(about three samples — instant) and falls to 0.0 with coefficient `0.004` (τ ≈ 250 samples
≈ 5.7 ms — fast, but slow enough not to click). The sequencer closes it **partway through
the step, not at the end**:

```cpp
double threshold = (samplesPerStep_ * (1.0 / 1.9)) * (1.0 - (boxAccent_ ? 0.25 : 0.0));
if (remaining < threshold && gateStat_ == 0) gateStat_ = 1;
```

A plain note therefore sounds for about **47 %** of its step and an accented one for about
**61 %** — accents are longer as well as louder. On a slide the gate is never closed and
the note runs unbroken into the next step.

**The summary worth carrying:** the loudness contour of a 303 note is *instant on, flat,
abrupt-but-smooth off*, and every expressive thing is happening in the filter. That is why
EnvMod, Decay and Accent are all filter controls, why the amplitude has no controls at all,
and why "reverse the envelope" is a statement about `boxDecay_` and nothing else.

---

### Reverse step (per-step reversed filter envelope)

**What it is for.** A normal step gives the filter opening then closing — the classic
*biu*. A reversed step plays that same envelope backwards, closing then opening, with the
bright moment arriving at the note's end — *bwi*. Before this flag a pattern committed to
one or the other. The point of **reverse step** is mixing them inside a single pattern:

```
biu  biu  biu  bwi  biu  bwi  biu  biu
```

One step sounding reversed against its neighbours, as if someone had flipped that step and
left the rest alone.

**Mechanically, it reverses the envelope in time.** The filter envelope `boxDecay_` normally
starts at 4.0 and decays by a fixed multiplier every sample (see "The envelope" above). A
reversed step starts it where the forward envelope would have *ended* and multiplies by the
**reciprocal**, so it climbs back to 4.0 and arrives there exactly as the note stops
sounding:

| | start of note | per sample |
|---|---|---|
| normal | `boxDecay_ = 4.0` | `*= r` |
| reversed | `boxDecay_ = 4.0 * pow(r, N)` | `*= 1.0 / r` |

Because `4·r^(N−t) == (4·r^N)·(1/r)^t`, that is genuinely the same curve read backwards —
not an upside-down one. The distinction is audible and it is the whole feature. An inverted
envelope moves fastest at the note's *start* and then flattens, which sounds like a filter
wobble; a reversed one is slow at first, accelerates, and peaks at the end, which is what a
backwards note sounds like. **Decay length becomes attack length.**

`N` is the note's *audible* length — its own step plus any steps tied to it by a slide, less
the tail of the final step after the gate closes. Aiming at the step boundary instead would
put the peak after the note had already gone silent.

**What it does not touch.** The amplitude path is untouched: loudness on a reversed step is
bit-for-bit what it would otherwise be, and the accent term stays additive. Only the filter
mirrors. It also never reads or writes EnvMod, so a sweep ramping EnvMod across the bar
behaves identically on reversed and normal steps.

**Slides carry the whole note.** The direction is latched only when a note actually starts,
not on every tied step, so a slid reversed note reverses across the entire tie rather than
changing direction partway through. That is the behaviour that makes a long reversed note
sound like a reversed long note.

**Two deliberate consequences:** the randomisers never set the flag, so random patterns come
out all-biu and every bwi is one you placed; and `resetTo303()` will not clear it, because
it is pattern data, not a sound parameter.

---

## File formats

All three are plain text, so they can be hand-inspected and diffed.

### `.roq` — song (read/write)

Estonian *röök*, "roar". Bundles patterns, every slider value and every sweep. Magic
`CreakboxRoq`, then a version integer, then one value per line.

Every version bump up to v9 only appended, so **old files load into new builds** with the
newer fields defaulting to their off/neutral values — a v1 song sounds today exactly as it
did.

**v10 is the exception, and it is handled by the version number rather than by the reader.**
Variable-length patterns changed the *number of step rows* in a pattern block, which is
positional and cannot be absorbed the way an appended field can. So the writer stamps the
lowest version that can represent the song: a song whose patterns are all 16 steps writes
exactly the bytes v9 wrote and still opens in an older build, and only a song that actually
uses another length declares v10. The header number means "what this file needs", not "what
wrote it".

v11 applies the same rule to an *appended* field for the first time, because the rule turned
out to be worth having generally: a song that never opened the Acid FX dialog still writes
v9 or v10 and still opens in an older build. The trigger is "some field differs from its
default", not "the effect would be audible" — a carrier frequency dialled in with the amount
left at zero is still something the user set, and dropping it to keep a version number down
would be the wrong trade.

v12 costs nothing at all, and it is worth seeing why. The triplet flag is appended as a
**second token on the pattern's `lastStep` line** rather than given a line of its own.
`readInt` parses with `std::stoi`, which reads the leading integer and stops — so an older
build reads `"11 1"` as `lastStep` 11 and simply never sees the flag. Same trick as the
per-step reverse column, and the reason to prefer extending a line over adding one.

The other direction is narrower than it sounds, and worth being precise about. A build
rejects a file whose version is higher than its own, with `unsupported .roq version` — it
does **not** try to read it and mis-parse. The header is positional (one value per line, in
a fixed order), so a partial read would silently shift every field after the missing one;
refusing is the right behaviour and it fails loudly. What *is* tolerant in both directions
is the **step line**, which grows by appending tokens rather than changing shape.

| Ver | Adds |
|---|---|
| 1 | patterns + 9 params + sweeps |
| 2 | `impulsive` (now deprecated, always written as 0) |
| 3 | `accentSquelch` |
| 4 | `pwm`, `subOscLevel`, `dupletWaveform`, `dupletDetune`, `dupletLevel` |
| 5 | `dupletDetune` becomes bipolar ±1200 cents; v4 values are rescaled on read |
| 6 | `dupletPWM` |
| 7 | `pwmLfoRate` (Hz), `pwmLfoDepth`, `pwmLfoDupletDepth` |
| 8 | `noiseLevel`, `resoBoost`, and a **fourth per-step column** (reverse step) |
| 9 | `distType`, `distGain`, `distTone`, `distLevel` |
| 10 | variable-length patterns — a pattern block holds `lastStep + 1` step rows instead of a fixed 16. **Written only when some pattern is not 16 steps.** |
| 11 | `compThreshold`, `compDepth`, `ringHz`, `ringAmount`. **Written only when one of them differs from its default.** |
| 12 | per-pattern triplet, as a second token on the pattern's `lastStep` line. **Written only when some pattern uses it**, and readable by older builds either way. |

The v8 step line is `pitch slide accent reverse`. Adding a token rather than changing the
line's shape is what keeps it readable in both directions: an older three-token parser
extracts the first three and ignores the rest.

### `.hape` — sweeps only (read/write)

A sweep collection on its own, for reusing a set of sweeps across songs. Magic
`CreakboxHape`. Saved and loaded from inside the sweep editor.

### `.cb` — 2002 module (import only)

The original Delphi format: CRLF, Windows-1252, 49 lines per pattern. **Fixed at 16 steps
per pattern** — the format has no length field and the reader counts lines, so a pattern of
any other length cannot be expressed in it at all. `saveCb()` exists
in the source but nothing in the UI reaches it — the File menu offers only **Import
legacy .cb**. Treat the format as read-only. Its schema is documented in
`reverse/cb_schema.md`.

### WAV render

**File → Save to WAV** renders the full song order once through, offline, into a 16-bit
WAV at the audio device's sample rate. It uses a detached engine instance, so the live
one keeps playing.

**Transport** — `F5` play current song from pattern 1 · `F6` loop the current pattern ·
`F7` play from the current pattern to the end · `F8` stop

F5–F8 are unconditional, not toggles, so F5 while already playing restarts the song and
F8 is safe to press when stopped. The on-screen button is still a toggle, and is
equivalent to F5 / F8.

**`Space` is deliberately not a transport key.** It was bound to run/stop, and because
accelerators are processed before `IsDialogMessage`, that swallowed the keystroke before
any control could see it — Space was dead on every checkbox and button in the window.
Transport moved to F5–F8 to give it back.

**Focused step**, from anywhere in the window: `Ctrl+Shift+A` accent · `Ctrl+Shift+S` slide
· `Ctrl+Shift+I` reverse · `Ctrl+Shift+G` randomise. One modifier for one idea — everything
that acts on the step the step list has focused.

**Sliders** — arrows ±1 · PgUp/PgDn ±10 · Home/End to the rails · **Enter opens the sweep
editor**

**Checkboxes** — `Space` **or Enter** toggles. Space is the system behaviour (it only
works now that transport has vacated it); Enter is a subclass, because
`IsDialogMessage` routes Enter to the default button and this window has none, so without
it Enter on a checkbox would do nothing while Enter on a slider opens a dialog.

### Mnemonics

A mnemonic that appears on two controls does **not** activate either — Win32 cycles focus
between the matches, which presents as "the key does nothing". Every live mnemonic on the
main window is now unique:

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Alt+W` Waveform | `Alt+M` Tempo | `Alt+Q` Accent squelch | `Alt+I` Wildness |
| `Alt+V` Volume | `Alt+C` Cutoff | `Alt+D` EnvMod | `Alt+Y` Decay |
| `Alt+U` Tuning | `Alt+B` Boost resonance | `Alt+O` Oscillator… | `Alt+X` Acid FX… |
| `Alt+T` Step selector | `Alt+N` Note | `Alt+A` Accent | `Alt+S` Resonance |
| `Alt+R` Run/Stop | `Alt+G` Pattern length | | |

**Triplet feel** has no mnemonic — every letter of it is taken — and lives on `Ctrl+T`.

Several moved off their first letter to break a collision, which is why they read oddly:
**Te&#95;m&#95;po**, **Deca&#95;y&#95;**, **T&#95;u&#95;ning**, **W&#95;i&#95;ldness** and
**EnvMo&#95;d&#95;**. A working awkward letter beats a natural one that does nothing.

**Three orders of precedence decide who gets a key, and every loser fails silently.** The
menu bar is consulted first, then accelerators, then mnemonics. So a main-window mnemonic on
`F`, `E`, `P`, `H` or `L` can never fire (those belong to the menus), and a mnemonic
shadowed by an accelerator on the same chord can never fire either.

Both used to happen here. `Alt+A`, `Alt+S` and `Alt+R` were bound as accelerators, so the
`&Accent` slider, `Re&sonance` slider and `&Run` button advertised keys they could never
receive; those accelerators moved to `Ctrl+Shift+A` / `Ctrl+Shift+S` / `Ctrl+Shift+G`.
`&EnvMod` advertised `Alt+E`, which only ever opened the Edit menu. **No plain `Alt+letter`
is bound as an accelerator any more**, which is what makes that whole class unrepeatable,
and `tools/check_keyboard.py` fails the build's keyboard check if one comes back.

Controls with no mnemonic left — the pattern combo, the three per-step checkboxes — say so
by having no underline, which is honest. **Their label names the chord instead**: `Slide this
step (Ctrl+Shift+S)`, `Triplet feel (Ctrl+T)`. A key nothing announces is a key nobody finds,
and the label is the only place a screen reader will read it.

A mnemonic would be the wrong shape for the per-step toggles in any case. They are used
*while arrowing through the step list*, and a mnemonic moves focus to the control it names —
so every toggle would throw you out of the list and cost a Tab to get back. An accelerator
fires without touching focus.

### Random-pattern flavours

Four pitch pools: **Nicely** (C-minor pentatonic), **Retro 2002** (the Delphi build's
Eb blues pool), **VST** (the 2004 C-major pentatonic) and **Chromatic** (all 60 pitches).
The wildness slider scales rest / slide / accent density for all of them.

## Repository layout

```
src/            standalone sources (compiled) + 2004 VST sources (reference only)
                  Distortion.* and AcidFx.* are the acid FX block; dist.cpp is the
                  untouched 2004 clipper the Classic model still calls
tools/          two standalone checks; no build, no dependencies
reverse/        reverse-engineering notes on the 2002/2004 originals
resource/       original 2002 resources
creakbox.txt    Bass Assessor's original 2002 release note
LICENSE         BSD 3-Clause, for this extension
license-bmd.txt the 2004 bioroid media development license for the VST sources in src/
```

Kept in the working tree but deliberately **not** in the repository: `modules/` (the `.cb`
presets and `.roq` songs), `CREAKBOX.EXE` (the original 2002 Delphi build), `cb303.wav`,
`reverse/ghidra_proj/` and `build/`. References to them elsewhere in this file and in
`CLAUDE.md` describe the local tree.

Run both checks after touching the things they cover. Each is stdlib-only Python and takes
under a second:

```
python tools/check_keyboard.py        after any resource.rc or control-label edit
python tools/check_dsp_ownership.py   after any CBEngine edit
```

They exist because everything they catch is **silent** — no error, no warning, no log line.
The keyboard one covers the six ways a key can quietly do nothing here; the ownership one
checks that non-atomic DSP state is written only on the audio thread, which is the property
ThreadSanitizer would have verified if MSVC shipped it.

`reverse/` is worth reading before changing anything engine-adjacent:

- `cb_schema.md` — the `.cb` file schema, derived by inspecting the preset library
- `parameter_map.md` — every control the 2002 Delphi UI exposed
- `signal_flow.md` — per-sample signal flow, 2002 exe vs. 2004 C++ source

## Engine invariants

These are load-bearing. Breaking one is silent — nothing fails to compile and nothing
throws.

1. **`resetFilters()` must not touch `pwmLfoPhase_`.** It zeroes the oscillator phases
   and runs at every pattern start. Adding the LFO phase there — which is exactly where
   it looks like it belongs — silently converts a free-running LFO into a per-pattern
   retrigger.
2. **`wwelti_IIR_IIRlp3pole` stays byte-for-byte as it is.** New filter behaviour goes
   into a sibling function. The stock path being unedited is the proof that the stock
   sound is unchanged.
3. **No allocation and no locking on the audio thread.** `process()` reads a const
   reference into a double-buffered snapshot and touches no mutex and no allocator. The
   rule is enforced, not hoped for: a test counts allocations inside `process()` with an
   `operator new` hook and asserts zero.
4. **Every new feature's off-state must be bit-identical** to the engine before it. This
   is testable, not aspirational: build the engine twice — current, and the previous
   engine reconstructed by reversing the patch — render both headlessly, and compare the
   bytes. The PWM LFO round and the noise / boost / reverse round were both verified this
   way, and the current build with every addition switched off is still bit-identical to
   the original pre-LFO engine.
5. **Skip work entirely when a feature is off**, rather than multiplying by a neutral
   value. The noise RNG must not advance at level 0, and neither the compressor's follower
   nor the ring carrier's phase may advance at amount 0 — otherwise invariant 4 stops
   holding the moment anyone touches the control and puts it back.
6. **State that never forgets needs resetting; state that forgets does not.** The ring
   carrier's phase is re-zeroed on every new note, because a phase accumulator drifts
   forever and would stop a one-pattern loop repeating identically. The compressor's
   envelope follower is deliberately *not* reset at pattern start, because a one-pole
   contracts — it converges within a fraction of a loop from any state, and resetting it
   would manufacture a burst of make-up gain on beat 1 of every bar. The PWM LFO is the
   third case: free-running on purpose, and resetting it is the documented trap.

## Known issues and loose ends

Tracked in full, with approach and acceptance tests, in **[`TODO.md`](TODO.md)**.

- **Legacy `.cb` sweeps are parsed and round-tripped but never applied.** The apply path is
  deliberately inert — the per-tab value curves are not fully decoded and applying the raw
  values silences many real presets. Both the inertness and the reason are commented at the
  call site so it is not deleted as dead code or switched on without decoding them first.
